# Assembly
The Assembly language is designated for the emu8086 program. It is designed as an emulator of the Intel's 8086 16 bit processor, therefore only registers up to 16 bits are available. Assembly is used to directly be 'in touch' with the CPU and its memory, therefore it is optimal for running microcontrollers and optimizing their resources and their allocation.
